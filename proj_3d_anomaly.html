      <h1>3D Anomaly Detection</h1>
      <p>
        This research investigates anomaly detection in 3D geometric data through the lens of Gaussian-based representation modeling. By learning spatial distributions within point clouds and volumetric embeddings, the framework identifies deviations from normality as probabilistic outliers in the learned Gaussian space. The method enhances structural awareness and uncertainty sensitivity, enabling precise localization of irregularities in complex 3D scenes. The ongoing work advances Gaussian field modeling as a foundation for reliable and interpretable 3D anomaly detection across real-world spatial domains.
