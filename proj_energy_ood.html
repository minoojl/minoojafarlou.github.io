      <p class="project-description">
        This body of work develops next-generation frameworks for dependable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in modern
        AI systems. The agenda centers on strengthening robustness, uncertainty awareness, and generalization under
        shifting data conditions—without disclosing implementation specifics. The studies span complementary paradigms and
        architectures, with active extensions across both vision and language, targeting scalable, modality-agnostic OOD
        detection for open-world deployment.
