    <h1>Semi-Supervised Sentiment Learning</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Labeling datasets is a noteworthy challenge in machine learning,
both in terms of cost and time. This research, however, leverages an
efficient answer. By exploring label propagation in semi-supervised
learning, we can significantly reduce the number of labels required
compared to traditional methods. We employ a transductive label
propagation method based on the manifold assumption for text
classification. Our approach utilizes a graph-based method to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data for text classification task,
which are then used to train deep neural networks. By extending
labels based on cosine proximity within a nearest neighbor graph
from network embeddings, we combine unlabeled data into supervised learning, thereby reducing labeling costs. Based on previous
successes in other domains, this study builds and evaluates this
approachâ€™s effectiveness in sentiment analysis, presenting insights
into semi-supervised learning.</p>
