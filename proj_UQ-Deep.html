    <h1>Uncertainty Quantification</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This work focuses on quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep learning systems to improve model reliability and decision-making under distributional shift. It explores principled ways to distinguish between model confidence and true epistemic uncertainty, emphasizing calibration, robustness, and interpretability. By integrating uncertainty estimation into the inference pipeline, the research aims to enable trustworthy deployment of AI models in both vision and language tasksâ€”ensuring that systems can reason not only about their predictions but also about their limits.</p>
