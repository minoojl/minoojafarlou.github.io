    <h1>Semi-Supervised Sentiment Learning</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Labeling datasets is a noteworthy challenge in machine learning,
      both in terms of cost and time. This research, however, leverages an
      efficient answer. By exploring label propagation in semi-supervised
      learning, we can significantly reduce the number of labels required
      compared to traditional methods. We employ a transductive label
      propagation method based on the manifold assumption for text
      classification. Our approach utilizes a graph-based method to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data for text classification task,
      which are then used to train deep neural networks. By extending
      labels based on cosine proximity within a nearest neighbor graph
      from network embeddings, we combine unlabeled data into supervised learning, thereby reducing labeling costs. Based on previous
      successes in other domains, this study builds and evaluates this
      approachâ€™s effectiveness in sentiment analysis, presenting insights
      into semi-supervised learning.</p>
