<h1>Integrative Causal Modeling of Brain Function through Multimodal fMRIâ€“MEG Connectivity Analysis</h1>
<p>
This project pioneers a multimodal approach to understanding brain causality by integrating Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to reveal how neural processes evolve across space and time. While fMRI provides high-resolution spatial mapping of hemodynamic activity, MEG captures the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics of neuronal signaling. Traditionally analyzed in isolation, these modalities are fused here within a unified causal inference framework to enable a more comprehensive understanding of brain connectivity.

A robust, containerized MEG preprocessing pipeline was developed for both resting-state and task-based data in the Dev-CoG dataset, automating artifact rejection, ICA decomposition, and component matching through advanced Hungarian and Greedy algorithms across multiple similarity metrics. Cross-modal alignment between MEG Independent Components and fMRI cortical maps was achieved using spatial, temporal, and functional correspondence, uncovering intricate patterns of inter-regional communication and advancing the frontier of multimodal neuroimaging.</p>
