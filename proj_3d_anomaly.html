  <h1>3D Anomaly Detection</h1>
  <p>
    This research investigates
    volumetric deep learning methods for structural anomaly detection in
    three-dimensional data such as industrial parts and medical scans. The
    focus is on designing representations that are robust to noise,
    misalignment, and sparse data regimes.
  </p>

  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Novel 3D encoderâ€“decoder architecture with anomaly scoring head.</li>
    <li>Evaluation on synthetic volumetric benchmarks with real-world transfer.</li>
    <li>Comparisons against autoencoders and flow-based generative models.</li>
    <li>Uncertainty-aware detection using Monte Carlo dropout.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The pipeline combines voxelized feature extraction, energy-based anomaly
    scoring, and uncertainty quantification. Training employs a hybrid objective
    that blends reconstruction with margin-based penalties, explicitly
    separating inlier and outlier distributions. This yields improved
    generalization and interpretable scoring, with implications for automated
    inspection in industrial and biomedical settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    This project contributes to the growing literature on 3D anomaly detection
    by highlighting the role of robust latent representations in safety-critical
    domains. Future work will explore extensions to point clouds and mesh
    domains, as well as real-time deployment in additive manufacturing
    pipelines.
