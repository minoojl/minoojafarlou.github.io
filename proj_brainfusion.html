<h1>Multimodal Causal Inference in Neuroimaging: SVAR-Based Integration of MEG and fMRI Networks</h1>
<p>Understanding causal mechanisms in brain function requires an integrative framework that captures both the temporal precision of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and the spatial specificity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, we employ Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) to model contemporaneous and lagged causal interactions among independent components derived from both modalities using the Dev-CoG dataset. SVAR enables explicit estimation of instantaneous causal effects across multimodal time series, revealing the dynamic interplay of neural regions in real time. To validate and extend these causal structures, we leverage the ION (Integration of Neuroimaging) algorithm, implemented in Clingo, to explore and refine graph topologies by integrating causal information across MEG- and fMRI-derived networks. Additionally, Naive Bayesian and Hungarian-based matching frameworks are applied to align components across modalities and quantify cross-modal correspondence. This pipeline—spanning preprocessing, graph construction, and fusion modeling—offers a robust architecture for uncovering strongly connected components (SCCs) and higher-order causal dependencies in brain networks. Through multimodal fusion, SVAR-driven causal inference, and logical graph optimization, our results advance the frontier of data-driven causal modeling in neuroimaging and lay groundwork for interpretable, temporally resolved connectivity analysis across the human brain.</p>
