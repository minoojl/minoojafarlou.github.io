    <h1>Semi-Supervised Sentiment Learning</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Labeling datasets is a noteworthy challenge in machine learning, both in terms of cost and time. This research leverages an efficient solution by exploring label propagation in semi-supervised learning, significantly reducing the number of required labels compared to traditional methods.</p>

    <p>We employ a transductive label propagation method based on the manifold assumption for text classification. Our graph-based approach generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are then used to train deep neural networks. By extending labels based on cosine proximity within a nearest-neighbor graph from network embeddings, we merge unlabeled data into supervised learning — reducing annotation costs and maximizing utility. Building on prior success in other domains, this study evaluates the approach’s effectiveness in sentiment analysis and provides insights into semi-supervised learning at scale.</p>
