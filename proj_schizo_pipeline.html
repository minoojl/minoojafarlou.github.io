<h1>A Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Framework for Schizophrenia Classification Using Imaging Genetics</h1>
<p>Schizophrenia (SZ) presents complex neuropathological patterns that require integrative models capable of combining structural, functional, and genetic information. This study proposes a deep learningâ€“based multimodal framework for SZ classification leveraging structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the FBIRN dataset. Morphological features were extracted from sMRI using a pre-trained DenseNet-121 network, while functional network connectivity (FNC) features were derived from fMRI through a one-dimensional CNN. Genetic biomarkers were identified by processing 4,943 SNPs with another 1D-CNN. To enhance interpretability, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was applied across modalities to visualize feature importance and identify neurobiologically meaningful regions and SNPs. The extracted features were fused into a unified vector representation and classified using an XGBoost model with five-fold cross-validation. The integrated model achieved an accuracy of 85.82%, outperforming unimodal baselines. Qualitative analysis revealed that the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical-sensorimotor connectivity, and several SZ-linked SNPs contributed most to model decisions. These findings demonstrate that combining deep transfer learning, explainable AI, and multimodal fusion provides a robust and interpretable approach for imaging-genetic classification of schizophrenia.</p>
